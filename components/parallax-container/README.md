# Introduction
This repository is a collection of 3 new web-components that can be combined to easily create a parallax effect for content on any site. These elements are designed for use in Polymer 1.0.

Check out the demo and docs here: https://winhowes.github.io/parallax-container/components/parallax-container/.

# Elements
